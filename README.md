## Hashes

A hash is a fixed-size string of characters generated by applying a hash function to a data input. Hash functions are mathematical algorithms that convert input data into a fixed-size string of characters. Hash functions are commonly used for password storage, data integrity verification, digital signatures, and more.

The Hash Buster program specifically supports the MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) hash algorithm. MD5 is a widely used hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value.

## Functionality

The Hash Buster program provides the following functionality:

1. **Generate Hash:** Allows you to generate an MD5 hash for a given plaintext.

2. **Decrypt Hash:** Attempts to decrypt an MD5 hash by comparing it against a wordlist or generating potential plaintexts based on a character set and maximum length.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the `hash_buster.py` file.

3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install pyfiglet colorama`.

4. Run the program by executing the `hash_buster.py` file.

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to generate or decrypt MD5 hashes.

Please note that the current version of the Hash Buster program supports only the MD5 hash algorithm. If you would like it to support more alorithms, lmk.
